Creativity blooms, innovation thrives,
Exploring ideas, where passion derives.
Equal opportunities, diversity embraced,
Inclusivity, a foundation well-placed.

Empowering students, digital pioneers,
Understanding technologies, erasing fears.
Shaping the future, with knowledge profound,
Computer science, a world unbound.

But challenges arise, like grading assignments,
Endless planning, where time never relents.
Troubleshooting issues, technical despair,
Explaining concepts, a constant affair.

Preparing students, a changing job sphere,
Appreciation lacking, the struggle is clear.
Engaging disinterested minds, a trial,
Staying updated, a never-ending mile.

Limited resources, funding in short supply,
Computer science education, a battle to defy.
Yet despite the cons, the struggles we face,
Teaching computer science, a noble embrace.

For the pros outweigh, the benefits immense,
Preparing students for a digital existence.
